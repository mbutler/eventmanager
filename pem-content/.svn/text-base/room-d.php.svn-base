<p>ICN meetings take priority over other meetings. Use of Room D as an ICN interactive classroom is restricted to authorized users. Hourly costs for the ICN connection will be billed to the user based on current video rates set by the Iowa Telecommunications and Technology Commission.</p>
<p>Groups eligible to use the Library's meeting rooms may schedule the ICN through the Library by calling 319-887-6007. An ICN reservation is not complete until the Library receives a reservation number from the ICN.</p>
<p>Evening meetings in Rooms A, B, C, and D must start at least one hour before the library closes, and all meeting attendees must be in the lobby or meeting rooms when the Library closes.</p>
